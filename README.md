# Infrastructure Automation with Ansible

This project showcases infrastructure automation using Ansible for configuration management and orchestration.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the documentation to start automating infrastructure with Ansible.

## Usage

1. Define your infrastructure in Ansible playbooks (`*.yml`) and roles.
2. Execute Ansible playbooks to configure, deploy, or manage servers, applications, and services.
3. Monitor and maintain infrastructure state using Ansible commands and modules.

## Documentation

- [Setup Guide](docs/SetupGuide.md): Instructions for setting up Ansible and configuring target hosts.
- [Ansible Playbooks](docs/AnsiblePlaybooks.md): Details on creating Ansible playbooks for infrastructure automation.

## Codebase

Develop Ansible playbooks (`server_configuration.yml`, `app_deployment.yml`, etc.) and roles that define infrastructure configuration and tasks. Organize them within an `ansible/` folder.

### Configuration Files

- `ansible.cfg` for Ansible configuration settings.
- Inventory file (`hosts`) to define target hosts or groups.
- Variable files (`vars/*.yml`) to store variables used in playbooks.

## Documentation

- `SetupGuide.md`: Detailed instructions on installing Ansible, setting up inventory, and managing credentials.
- `AnsiblePlaybooks.md`: Explanation of Ansible playbooks, roles, tasks, and best practices for infrastructure automation.

## Tests

Implement tests to validate the Ansible playbooks' execution and infrastructure configuration. Example:

```bash
# Automated tests (can be shell scripts or other appropriate tests)
ansible-playbook --syntax-check server_configuration.yml
ansible-playbook --check server_configuration.yml
ansible-playbook server_configuration.yml
# Additional tests to verify the infrastructure state
